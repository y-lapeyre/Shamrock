# SHAMROCK — Project Guide

## What is this project

SHAMROCK is a C++20 hydrodynamics framework built with SYCL, MPI,
and Python. SYCL backend support covers every major implementation
(AdaptiveCpp, DPC++, intel/llvm). It uses CMake (generators: make or
Ninja depending on availability) and has submodules.

## Building

A "machine" is one OS + hardware combination.
Run `./env/new-env` without arguments to see the
full list of available machine configurations.

### Step 0 - Check the already existing build folder

Check if a folder with a `shamenv_do` script already exists. If it does, **do not re-run `./env/new-env`** — the environment is already configured. Skip directly to Step 4 (Build). Only run `./env/new-env` when creating a brand-new build directory.

### Step 1 — Select a machine

```bash
./env/new-env
```

Pick one from the list (e.g. `debian-generic.acpp` on Debian).

### Step 2 — Inspect machine-specific options

```bash
./env/new-env --machine <selected machine> --builddir build -- --help
```

This shows the flags specific to that machine — they can vary widely.

### Step 3 — Create the environment

```bash
./env/new-env --machine <selected machine> --builddir build -- \
  <machine specific flags>
```

### Step 4 — Build

```bash
cd build
./shamenv_do shamconfigure # alias to the correct cmake command
./shamenv_do shammake      # alias to ninja build (or make if ninja is unavailable)
```

Always use something like `&& echo DONE` after the build command to avoid confusion since `ninja` sometimes can do a successful build without showing 100% in the steps.

Check if `./shamrock`, `./shamrock_test` are present in the build dir, if yes it has succeeded.

### Incremental builds

A full `./shamenv_do shammake` compiles every target (~40min from a cold
build) — do not run it after every small change. When you modify a single
component, build only that component's target instead:

```bash
cd build
./shamenv_do shammake <target>   # e.g. shammake shammodels_sph
```

List available targets with:

```bash
ninja -t targets all | grep ': phony$'
```

Only run a full `./shamenv_do shammake` (or build `shamrock`/`shamrock_test`
specifically) when unit tests need to run or the binary needs to execute —
those require the whole dependency graph to be up to date anyway.

## Testing

**BEFORE running any unittest, always check that reference files exist.**
If `build/reference-files` is missing or stale, call `./shamenv_do pull_reffiles` to fetch them.
Running tests without pulled reference files will produce failures.

```bash
# Step 1 — ensure reference files are pulled
cd build
test -d reference-files || ./shamenv_do pull_reffiles

# Step 2 — list devices for user selection
./shamenv_do ./shamrock --smi          # or ./shamrock_test --smi
```

Never truncate the output of `--smi` with `head` or similar — it contains device IDs needed to run tests.

Show the device table from the `--smi` output and **ask the user to select which device to use**. Do NOT pick a device yourself. **Prompt the user only once** and remember their choice for the rest of the session — reuse the same device for all subsequent test runs unless asked otherwise. Then run with the user-selected device ID:

```bash
./shamenv_do ./shamrock_test --sycl-cfg <user-chosen-id>:<user-chosen-id> --loglevel 1 --unittest
```

## Code style & linting

- **Formatter**: `.clang-format`
- **CI linter**: `.clang-tidy`
- **Pre-commit hooks**: `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
- Run `pre-commit run --all-files` before committing

## Naming conventions (enforced as warnings by `.clang-tidy` `CheckOptions`)

| Entity                            | Case       |
| --------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Class/Struct/Enum/Union           | CamelCase  |
| Function/Variable/Parameter       | lower_case |
| Member                            | lower_case |
| Constant (incl. class `static constexpr`) | lower_case |
| Namespace                         | lower_case |
| Macro                             | UPPER_CASE |
| Enum value                        | CamelCase  |
| Template parameter (type, e.g. `Tvec`) | CamelCase  |
| Template parameter (non-type, e.g. `dim`) | lower_case |

Enum values use **acronym-preserving CamelCase**: each word is
capitalized, but a word that is itself a recognized acronym (a
vendor/hardware name like `AMD`, `CPU`, `GPU`, or a numerical-method name
like `CG`, `PCG`, `HLL`) is kept fully capitalized as that one word
instead of only its first letter (`Nvidia`, but `AMD`, `CPU`, `CUDA`,
`PCG`). A plain English word typed in caps for consistency (`UNKNOWN`,
`MULTIGRID`) is not an acronym and should be normalized (`Unknown`,
`Multigrid`). When the value names a specific external technology with
its own established spelling (`OpenMP`, `ROCm`, `BiCGSTAB`), match that
spelling rather than deriving one mechanically.

Note: `readability-identifier-naming`'s `CamelCase` check only rejects a
name with an underscore or a lowercase first letter, so it can't tell an
acronym from a plain word typed in caps by mistake — it won't flag
`UNKNOWN` even though the convention above says it should become
`Unknown`. Treat the table above as the target and fix those on sight.

### File naming

- A file that implements a single class/struct is named after that type
  in CamelCase (e.g. `PatchDataField.hpp` for `class PatchDataField`).
- A file that holds a free-function algorithm, a kernel, or a bag of
  related utilities (no single owning type) is named in `lower_case`
  (e.g. `compute_ranges.hpp`, `key_morton_sort.hpp`).
- This is not enforced by clang-tidy (no such check exists there); it's a
  review-time convention.

## Files to avoid modifying unless explicitly asked

- `.github/workflows/*.yml` — CI workflows.
- `external/` submodules — upstream dependencies.
- `LICENSE`, `LICENSE.en` — legal files.

## Git, commits & pull requests

The upstream repo is `Shamrock-code/Shamrock`. Open pull requests against
upstream `main` on that repo.

### Commit authorship

Commit-msg hooks can rewrite the author and inject `Co-authored-by` (often
with a model name). After every `git commit`, amend with `--no-verify`
before pushing (a plain amend re-runs the hook):

- **Author** = the human who initiated the work. Use `--author`; do not
  change gitconfig.
- Trailer = `Assisted-by: <agent>` only. No model names. No
  `Co-authored-by` (`Co-authored-by` is for extra human authors only). Also
  no session url.

Check `git log -1 --format='Author: %an <%ae>%n%B'` before push.

### Opening pull requests

Target upstream `Shamrock-code/Shamrock` and base branch `main`.

If the agent environment can only open a PR on a fork, put an upstream compare
link at the top of the PR description so the user can open the PR against
upstream directly:

```text
https://github.com/Shamrock-code/Shamrock/compare/main...<fork-owner>:Shamrock:<branch>?expand=1
```

Replace `<fork-owner>` and `<branch>` with the fork owner and branch name.

PR lookups should also target upstream:

```bash
gh pr list --repo Shamrock-code/Shamrock
gh pr view <number> --repo Shamrock-code/Shamrock
```

## Quick reference: common commands
