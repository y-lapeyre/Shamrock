     * related to read and write operations of the buffer. The class has two states: incomplete
     * and complete.
     *
     * - When the class is in an incomplete state, this is the case when an access was queried (by
     * calling `read_access` or `write_access`) until the event is registered using
     * `complete_state`.
     * - When the class is in a complete state, it means that the buffer access events are up to
     * date.
     *
     * The class is designed to work with SYCL USM buffers.
